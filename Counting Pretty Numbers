// Vasya likes the number 239. Therefore, he considers a number pretty if its last digit is 2, 3 or 9.
// Vasya wants to watch the numbers between L and R (both inclusive), so he asked you to determine how many pretty numbers are in this range.
code:
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	// your code goes here
	int t;
	cin>>t;
	while(t--){
	    int L,R; // given range (L --> R)
	    int count = 0; // assume initially she has Zero pretty numbers
	    cin>>L>>R;
	    for(int i =L; i<=R;i++){
	        if(i%10 == 2 || i%10== 3 || i%10== 9){ //divide the number with 10 if reminder comes 2, 3 or 9 then number is considered to be pretty
	            count++; //increment 'count'
	        }
	    }
	    cout<<count<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
